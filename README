Consider a network G=(V,E) with E bidirectional channels. 
The nodes of the network are identified with the integers 1, 2, 3, ..., N.

Node 1 needs to know the identifications of each node as well as its neighbor identifications,
so node 1 broadcasts a message with its request.

Write an efficient program that will accomplish the above request.

Count the total number of hops that will be traveled, in both directions,
in order to accomplish the above task. Efficient means to minimize the overall number of hops.
Also compute the longest path (in number of hops) that a message will travel from node 1
to some other node in the network - this is called the diameter of the network.

Run your program for
	1. a 10-node ring
	2. a degree 4 hypercube
	3. a 12-node complete graph
	
Submit: Your program;
		The total cost in hops;
		The diameters
		
A report with some discussion about your program as well an analysis of the program
with the calculation of its complexity.
